Hello! My name is Jemima and welcome ***Type or Typo?***

I am a second-year Media, Journalism and Publishing student at Oxford Brookes University. This blog site is the main project for my module on Typographic Design for Page and Screen. It has allowed me to unite my appreciation for visual creation with my passion for writing. I am also a self-confessed Bibliophile and therefore adore any and all things book related! In this blog, I am able to combine all these things to create an internet space where I discuss, compare, and contrast typography within the book industry. 

A typical blog post will see me discussing some iconic typography being used on a book cover, an advertisement or even a storefront and letting you know whether is really is type or a typo! 

I hope to radiate my love for books across my site in order that I might attract another fellow book lover or, even better still, maybe help convince a browser on here to discover their own love for books. In order to do this, I have created a logo that displays the comparative attitude that I hope to convey on this blog by reflecting that within my logo with the use of a more traditional serif font commonly seen in novels (Baskerville) with a typewriter-like font know as Old Typewriter. Combined with this the 't' for 'Typo' or slightly off centre to convey the idea that it is a typo. The neutral tones displayed behind these letterforms are again reminiscent of the colour of book pages and what I hope is the honesty I hope to display on this blog.

Because this blog is centred around typography within books (and just because I love books!) I chose to chose display my headings in Libre Baskerville as it is the most popular font that is used for the text within fiction books.
