Within the world of the book lover, perhaps the most comforting and reassuring place to be, is in the bookshop. Whether you are settling down to do some work at the coffeeshop within, or simply browsing the shelves to wait out a rainstorm, there's nothing quite like it.

But what makes a bookshop seem like the place to be? Contrary to what our hearts like to believe, this haven to the bookish soul is a business and the centre of the brand is displayed to the public via aesthetics and aesthetics alone.

The two giants of the Book Industry lie across the Atlantic from one another. These are of course; Barnes & Noble and Waterstones. While both holding their own in their own right they approach very different marketing strategies. Their branding comes to a head with the typography they choose to use.

### Barnes & Noble

The American super-store encompasses the American look with the words 'Barnes' and 'Noble' bodly stamped out in *Bureau Grot Comp Medium* filling the eyes of the reader, claiming its space just as the company's buildings themselves impose upon their customers.

The word 'Booksellers' takes up its place, within the logo, beneath the company name. It is set in a more traditional font called *Mrs Eaves Bold* which perhaps mimics the general fonts found in the text of most novels.

### Waterstones
