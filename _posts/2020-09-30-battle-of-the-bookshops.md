Within the world of the book lover, perhaps the most comforting and reassuring place to be, is in the bookshop. Whether you are settling down to do some work at the coffeeshop within, or simply browsing the shelves to wait out a rainstorm, there's nothing quite like it.

But what makes a bookshop seem like the place to be? Contrary to what our hearts like to believe, this haven to the bookish soul is a business and the centre of the brand is displayed to the public via aesthetics and aesthetics alone.
