Within the world of the book lover, perhaps the most comforting and reassuring place to be is in the bookshop. Whether you are settling down to do some work at the coffee shop within, or simply browsing the shelves to wait out a rainstorm, there's nothing quite like being surrounded by books.

But what is it that makes a bookshop seem like *the* *place* to be? Contrary to what our hearts like to believe, this haven to the bookish soul is a business and the centre of the brand is displayed to the public via aesthetics and aesthetics alone.

The two giants of the Book Industry bookshop-wise lie across the Atlantic from one another. These are of course; **Barnes & Noble** and **Waterstones**. Interestingly in 2019 the CEO of **Waterstones** James Daunt bought **Barnes & Noble**. Despite belonging to the same parent company (Elliott Management Corporation), the two brands approach a very different look aesthetics-wise. The most obvious element of their branding would of course be the typography they choose to use.

### Barnes & Noble

The American super-store encompasses the American look with the words '**Barnes**' and '**Noble**' bodly stamped out in *Bureau Grot Comp Medium* filling the eyes of the reader, claiming its space just as the company's buildings themselves impose upon their customers. This is a standard looking font similar to other popular ones like *Bebas Neue* and *Oswald*. With minimal tracking between characters and completely capitalised letters, *Bureau Grot Comp Medium* is easy to read and impossible to miss.

Originally, the word '**Booksellers**' took up its place, within the logo, beneath the company name. It was set in a more traditional serif font called *Mrs Eaves Bold* which perhaps mimicked fonts commonly found in the text of most novels. However, within recent years the chain decided to drop the additional text and simplify the logo to keep up with the times, adopting a more minimal look. Many stores are yet to update their signs.

Now, what some might say is the only characterful piece in the brand's typography is the ampersand found between the two company names. The uniform, blocks of green are broken up by a golden, sometimes orange, symbol simultaneously destroying the harmony *and* joining the **Barnes** brothers with their co-founder G. Clifford **Noble**.

Despite having launched well over 100 years ago, Barnes & Noble remains one of the giants in the book industry with over 600 retails stores and near-worldwide recognition.

### Waterstones

Like Barnes & Noble, Waterstones is named after its founder Tim Waterstone. However, unlike its US equivilant, it was only founded 38 years ago and is represented by far fewer stores. Another difference that the two companies share is the contrast to one another in terms of their typography.

The word '**Waterstones**' stands alone, unobtrusive but bold in its simplicity. The typeface the word is displayed in is one of the most recognisable fonts across the globe: *Baskerville*. *Baskerville* is a serif typeface that was designed in the 1750s by a Mr John *Baskerville*. While elegant it remains easy to read and unlike earlier serif fonts, has a larger distinction between strokes used. This makes it very popular in book design which is most likely the reason why Waterstones adopted it as their own.

Despite the popularity of the typeface, the Waterstones logo is easily identifiable. The association with the written word allows what could be a rather plain font to be a characterful, strong logo for the brand. The consistently, monochromatic look again emphasises the idea that this is a brand about books, giving the impression that the letters have been freshly printed with ink on to its website and stores etc.
