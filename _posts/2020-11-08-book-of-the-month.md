Book of the Month is one of the most successful and unique subscription services out there. Each month subscribers are allowed to pick one hardcover book from a selection of five to receive for the inexpensive fee of $14.99 per month. Unlike other book subscription boxes, Book of the Month allow their subscribers to skip a month with no charge if none of the ones in that selection interests them.
