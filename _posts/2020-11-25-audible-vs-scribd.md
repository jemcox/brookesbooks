Audiobooks have been available to the public since the 1970s when libraries started stocking casette tapes of popular books but it wasn't until the 1990s that audio really took off as audio became more portable.

Audiobook giant, Audible, was founded in 1995 by Don Katz. It is now the world's most popular audiobook and podcast platform and was bought by Amazon in 2008.

Scribd is Audible's greatest competitor. It was founded the year before Amazon bought Audible (in 2007).
