Out of all of the elements of the term *gothic* - think haunted houses, candlelight and howling winds - great works of literature come to mind. Perhaps the two most infamous examples of this are the literary masterpieces that are Dracula by Brahm Stoker and Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. While both stories differ quite drastically in content, they are often grouped together when it comes to the cover-designer's font choice. The most iconic and widely seen being any variation found under the name **Old English** examples of which inlude:

* Amador
* Blackletter
* Cloister Black
* Helmsweld Post
* Old London
* Mariage
