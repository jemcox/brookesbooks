Twelve times a year subscription box company Fairy Loot sends 6-7 bookish goodies out to their customers along with a signed, hardcover new release to add to their bookshelves.

The brand has gained popularity after gifting their boxes to various Instagrammers, Bloggers and YouTubers to feature in their posts via unboxings or photographs displaying items. 

Fairy Loot clearly reveals themselves as a subscription box based around books within the Fantasy genre. A fairy is seen sitting in a wreath made of branches or twigs, holding a book and next to her lies the Fairy Loot typographic logo. The typeface that the logo is written in again lends itself to the fantasy genre with a font is handwritten in style with twining, flourishing serifs. The one on the 'F' looking like a vine extending from the letter itself.
