In 2008, design studio MinaLima produced editions of classic children's stories quite unlike any before. These copies maintained the simple beauty of the pop-up book while encasing it in a cover that looked deluxe and gift-worthy. Their covers harp back to a time when novels were bound in leather and imprinted with gold lettering but bright colours and unique illustrations bring a modern twist to these beautiful collector's pieces.

Both the font used for 'Beauty' and 'Beast' and the font used for 'the' and 'and the' were specifically created by the design company for these classics editions.

The authors' names and description of the novel are written in *Elongated Roman*, a tall, capitalised serif font where all the letters are the same height. This uniformed font is easy to read while still adding a unique flair to tie in with the rest of the elements on the book cover.
