In 2008, design studio MinaLima produced editions of classic children's stories quite unlike any before. These copies maintained the simple beauty of the pop-up book while encasing it in a cover that looked deluxe and gift-worthy. Their covers harp back to a time when novels were bound in leather and imprinted with gold lettering but bright colours and unique illustrations bring a modern twist to these beautiful books.
