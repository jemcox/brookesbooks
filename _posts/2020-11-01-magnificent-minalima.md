In 2008, design studio MinaLima produced editions of classic children's stories quite unlike any before. These copies maintained the simple beauty of the pop-up book while encasing it in a cover that looked deluxe and gift-worthy. Their covers harp back to a time when novels were bound in leather and imprinted with gold lettering but bright colours and unique illustrations bring a modern twist to these beautiful collector's pieces. 

As of November 2020 there are currently six books in the MinaLima classics editions. For the sake of looking at the covers a little more closely so as to analyse the fonts, I will be using *The Beauty and the Beast* as an example.

Both the font used for '*Beauty*' and '*Beast*' and the font used for '*the*' and '*and* *the*' were specifically created by the design company for these classics editions.

The authors' names and description of the novel are written in **Elongated Roman**, a tall, capitalised serif font where all the letters are the same height. This uniformed font is easy to read while still adding a unique flair to tie in with the rest of the elements on the book cover.
